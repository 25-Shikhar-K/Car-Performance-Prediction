# Car-Performance-Prediction
It focuses on developing a reliable car performance prediction model. Firstly, we preprocess the dataset to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. This includes handling missing data, eliminating redundant features, and normalizing numerical variables. Next, we aim to identify and handle any anomalies or outliers present in the dataset. To predict car performance accurately, we utilize multiple regression models, specifically the Random Forest Regressor, K-Neighbors Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, and Multiple Linear Regressor. Each of these models has its unique characteristics and strengths, making them suitable for different scenarios. After training each regression model using appropriate training and validation techniques, we evaluate their performance using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. RMSE measures the average distance between the predicted values and the actual values. A lower RMSE indicates a more accurate prediction. By comparing the RMSE values of the different models, we can select the one that performs the best in terms of predicting car performance accurately.
